# Athena
An optimizing compiler that implements a custom language

## Description and Aim:
This project implements a language called "Athena" (the compiler has the same name as the language for the time being), which, so far, is an imperative procedural language like C++. I started this project, without any specific ideas for what use case or specialization I could tailor my language to. Hence, for now, it's like C++, but, obviously less powerfull.
